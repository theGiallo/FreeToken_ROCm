"""Grouped expert GEMM over native GGUF expert banks (borrowed ggml MoE kernels).

Ports vLLM/sglang's ``_fused_moe_gguf`` MMVQ path onto FreeToken's offload-cache
interface: the experts are streamed to the GPU as packed ggml block bytes and
dequantized *inside* ``ggml_moe_a8_vec`` -- no bf16 expert copy is materialized. We
use the MMVQ (vector) kernel for both prefill and decode: it consumes ``topk_ids``
directly (no ``moe_align_block_size`` needed) and on small batches it is the right
choice anyway. ``topk_ids`` already index the streamed cache slots (decode) or the
materialized layer positions (prefill).

The ggml quant type travels per bank: historically both banks were Q4_0 (hence the
module name), but any type with an MMVQ dot implementation works -- e.g. Qwen3.x GGUF
checkpoints mix Q4_K gate/up with Q6_K down.
